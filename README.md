# LKG App Template

This is an example raylib project designed to facilitate performant, realtime rendering on the Raspberry Pi for the Looking Glass Portrait. 

It also includes a scene system (see scene.h) to quickly create new content for the LKG.

## Building

Please use Raspberry Pi OS Lite and the provided boot config files. Make sure your user has permission to use the GPU.
